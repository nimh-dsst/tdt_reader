# tdt_reader

## Author: Joshua Lawrimore, PhD

## Modified Date: April 9th, 2025

Modified version of the tdt TDTbin2py module to replace `read_block` function with `read_block_with_ts` function. The `read_block_with_ts` function allows the export of ts array for streams.

Please note, this code is a work in progress.
